To be able to run "SurfaceXplorerPython" you need to have Python installed on your computer.
This version of the program was tested with the Anaconda Python Distribution 2021.05 and Python 3.8.
For other computer systems, please go to Anaconda website at
www.anaconda.com and download a version suitable for your computer.

If you want to install Python on your own, make sure you also have the following libraries:
1. Numpy
2. Scipy
3. Matplotlib

After installing Python open a command prompt and run the following command without quotes (in the folder where main.py is located):
"python main.py"
Alternatively, you can start a python IDE and run main.py from there... Whatever is more convenient.

For adding/changing models in the model library, open the file "model_library.py" in any text
editor and follow the instructions in the file header.

Happy fitting!!!
